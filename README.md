Kasparov is a web panel for managing remote servers and doing some common tasks on them, 
designed for non-technology oriented people who want to perform some basic tasks, like setting up a web server.


# Overview (Technology standpoint)
- AsyncIO+Autobahn for websockets (Python)
- AngularJS for data-binding
- Restangular, Marshmallow (Python) for various other things
- Bootstrap for design

# Dragons Beware

Code can be very VERY rough around the edges at the moment (and broken...).
It's getting better all the time!.
